## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

To run the tests:

```bash
npm test
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

I added test coverage for the function which calculates the pension accumulation, and I assumed that even after the retirement year, a 4.9% interest is calculated on the balance even when the desired amount is deducted from the balance.
